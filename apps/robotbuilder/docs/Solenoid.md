Solenoids
===

Solenoids are electrcally controled pneumatic valves.

### <a name="single_solemoid"></a> Spring Return Solenoid
A spring return solenoid or just solenoid for short has two states, on and off. When in the off state a spring pulls the valve into its starting configuration. When in the on state (energised) the magnetic field generated in the solenoid by the electric current pulls the valve intos its alternate configuration. 

### <a name="double_solemoid"></a> Double Solenoid
A double solenoid operates much like a single solenoid, but has two separate actuators and no spring. One actuator pulls the valve into its "reverse" state, while the other actuator pulls the valve into its forward state. When neither actuator is energised the valve holds its previous state.
