EasyJ4FRC
=========

Easily program your FRC robot with the block programming tool Blockly

My goal is to allow FRC Rookies and new programmers to get their feet wet with some Java code using the WPI Robotics Library.

## Demo
A recent build of the EasyJ4FRC environment is available here:   
[EasyJ4FRC Demo](http://easyj.team5122.com/)

## Credits
EasyJ4FRC is based on [Google Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/).
